      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>I was born in 1984, in the eastern part of flanders. </br>
			I studied Modern Languages and Sciences in high school in Turnhout,
			after which I started studies on European Politics at the University of Maastricht.
			These studies were a firm struggle for me, as it was not my passion at all.
			That's why my career path might look kind of a labyrinth. But please read more about my career on the <a href="about/career.html">career-page</a>.
		</br>Today I'm living in Overijse, one of the most beautiful places in flanders for cyclists and for grape lovers.
			I'm a Lean Professional at Colruyt Group, like to play football and love to watch cyclism. Especially the flanders classics.
			When I am not working I spend most of my time with my family, sometimes in the garden, otherwhise playing a board game.
			And like most of use, I spend my evenings, seated for netflix.
